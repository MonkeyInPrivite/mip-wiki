# Contribution Guide (WIP)
When submitting a contribution, please follow these general rules to keep everything nice and organized!

1. All contributions must be appropriate, relevant to the page, and not malicious in any way.
2. Please adhere to the [Style Guide](../style.md).
3. If you are referencing an external file, confirm that it is safe (obviously), but also avoid adding it to content/Database/assets if possible. Try looking for a GitHub repo or another trusted site. If you cannot, add it to assets **in a completely unmodified form**. Even distributing a Scriptlet with a different icon will have your commit edited.
