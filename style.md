# MIP Wiki Style Guide
This page aims to be a simple breakdown of how pages should be written on this Wiki!

# Capitalization 
- Capitalize trademarks like "Kindle"
- Capitalize KMC specific terms like "KMRP" or "KUAL"
- Capitalizing "Scriptlet" is preferred

# Linking
- When linking to other pages on the site, please use the file path and not the url.
*Wrong Example:* `[click here for free ebooks](https://mip-wiki.pages.dev/database/assets/EasyBrick.sh)`
*Correct Example:* `[click here for free ebooks](../assets/EasyBrick.sh)`

# Guides
- When writing steps, please format them in chronological order
Ex:
> 1. Open kterm
> 2. Run `./EasyBrick.sh`
- Use Markdown features to your benefit! You can check out the [Hextra Guide](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/guide/markdown/) for an amazing list!
- In the credits, try to link to someone's GitHub/anywhere else!

# About Us
Along with your first contribution, you get a page on the About Us section! Please try to keep your introduction under 2 paragraphs 😂, but we also love hearing about you!

# Common Sense
With all of these rules, please use common sense and discretion, there is no possible way to make an all size fits all style guide. Obviously make sure everything you add is relevant and *appropriate*.

# Enforcement 
Per these rules, anyone caught breaking the style guide will have their contributions removed, be removed as a collaborator, and be executed at high noon. Ok maybe not 😅
Please try to follow these to the best of your ability! If you notice that somebody has accidentally forgotten one of these, please edit the page to fix it. Feel free to add "Style Fix" to the name of the commit if you want.
