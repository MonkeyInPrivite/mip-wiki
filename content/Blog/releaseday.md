Whelp, it's that day.

GreenCat, Penguins, LOT, and I have been working super hard on this for the past 2 months, and we hope you all enjoy!

This all started out as an idea for a more useful and in depth FAQ, and Jakub is actually the one who gave me the motivation to start it! (thx Jakub!!!)

I never imagined that it turn into all of this, and thank you to the team for helping along the way ♥️
