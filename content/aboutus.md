# MonkeyInPrivite
Hi! My (screen)name is MonkeyInPrivite, which is where the name of this wiki comes from! I started off in the Kindle scene by watching [Jeff's video](https://youtu.be/Qtk7ERwlIAk) and bought a PW6 (Paperwhite 12th Gen) and was VERY relieved to see it was on 5.17.0! Before during and after the jailbreak process, I was constantly reading all of the documentation and guides about jailbreaking. Which ment that after jailbreaking I already knew a lot about Kindles! I eventually started using this knowledge to help people in #questions-and-support on KMC, and I eventually was invited to the Helper team! I officially took on the online name "MonkeyInPrivite" in 2023, but I do have older accounts! I try to stay anonymous online, which has oddly lead to some controversy, but honestly I don't really care 😂.
