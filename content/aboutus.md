# MonkeyInPrivite
Hi! My name is MonkeyInPrivite, which is where the name of this wiki comes from! I started off in the Kindle scene by watching [Jeff's video](https://youtu.be/Qtk7ERwlIAk) and bought a PW6 (Paperwhite 12th Gen) and was VERY relieved to see it was on 5.17.0! Before during and after the jailbreak process, I was constantly reading all of the documentation and guides about jailbreaking. Which meant that after jailbreaking I already knew a lot about Kindles! I eventually started using this knowledge to help people in #questions-and-support on KMC, and I eventually was invited to the Helper team! I officially took on the online name "MonkeyInPrivite" in 2023, but I do have older accounts! You can also call me "MIP" but a lot of people just say monkey 😂. Also for clarification, in real life I hate cats but monkeys are my favorite animal. I try to stay anonymous online, which has oddly lead to some controversy, but honestly I don't really care 😂.

# GreenCat777

Howdy there! I’m GreenCat777, you can call me GC, Green, Cat, GreenCat, whatever you want. I got into Kindle jailbreaking from [Jeff’s video](https://youtu.be/Qtk7ERwlIAk) (Jeff's a great Youtuber, go watch his stuff).
Just like Monkey, I read all the docs, and then I read the actual guide for WinterBreak, only to find out it had to be below 5.18.1. I was on 5.18.4.........
I joined KMC and started reading more docs, after jailbreaking with AdBreak, I helped a lot of people in the #questions-and-support channel Monkey noticed this and managed to make me a Helper, meanwhile I started making SH shortcuts and eventually got better and made more packages and even Linux ports.
