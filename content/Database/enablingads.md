1. Make sure your Kindle is registered in an ad-supported region. (US or France)
2. Go [here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/alldevices) for US or [here](https://www.amazon.fr/hz/mycd/digital-console/alldevices) for France
3. Select Kindles and choose yours, then press Enable Offers. If it says Disable or active then it's already enabled.
4. Profit!

# Troubleshooting
Are ads still not enabling? Make sure the Kindle's compatible, then try this.

1. Make sure ads are enabled for the right Kindle on the Amazon website.
2. Toggle Ads on and off (if it's free).
3. Attempt a factory reset.
