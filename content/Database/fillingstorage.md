You have to fill the storage on your Kindle during jailbreaking in order to prevent updates that can ruin your jailbreak. This guide covers the 3 methods of doing so.

## Method 1 - hhhhhhhhh's Powershell Script
1. Download the script [here](../assets/kindle_fill.ps1)
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file to in the command prompt.
3. Run the command ```powershell -STA -executionpolicy bypass .\kindle_fill.ps1```

## Method 2 - Use premade filler files
1. Download one of the files from [here](https://github.com/iiroak/Kindle-Filler-Disk/tree/main/MTP)
2. Transfer enough of the files to your Kindle to fill the storage.

## Method 3 - Use Random Junk Files
1. Find any random files, preferably larger ones or use a [dummy file generator](https://pinetools.com/random-file-generator)
2. Simply copy them to your Kindle

> [!TIP]
> For methods 2 and 3, it can be useful to put the files in a dedicated folder as to not clutter everything.
