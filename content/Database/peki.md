PEKI is an alternative to MRPI for installing KUAL (holy acronyms). MRPI along with just being old, has many issues and will not work in a lot of scenarios.

## Installing PEKI
1. Get the latest PEKI.zip from [here](https://github.com/KindleTweaks/PEKI/releases/latest/download/PEKI.zip)
2. Copy all the files in it to the documents folder on your Kindle
3. Run the scriptlet from your home screen.
