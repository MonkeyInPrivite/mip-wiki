Scriptlets are one of the most used methods of running apps on the Kindle, and this page explains what they are, and how to use them.

## How to use Scriptlets
1. Download the scriptlet. They are presented as .sh (shell) files.
2. Connect your Kindle to your computer
3. Place the scriptlet in your documents folder (so the path would look like documents/scriptlet.sh)
4. The scriptlet should appear on your home screen as a book. Click it to run.

## What are Scriptlets
Scriptlets are managed by SH_Integration (part of the Hotfix) which have a file extension of .sh which is also commonly used upon desktop Linux. This essentially means they are automated command lines. Scriptlets are special because when they are placed into the documents folder in your kindle they appear as a "book" or "booklet." And they can also be embedded with metadata such as Name, Author, and Icon. For info on developing scriptlets look here on the [kindlemodding.org Website](https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-dev/scriptlets.html).
