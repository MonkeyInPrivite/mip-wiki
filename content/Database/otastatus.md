OTA Blocking is one of the most important steps when it comes to jailbreaking, and if you're like me you want to make sure that you did it right. 

## If you used the instructions [on the Kindle Modding Wiki](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/disable-ota.html)
1. Download the [Check OTA Status script by neura](../assets/Check OTA status.sh)
2. Place the file in your documents folder
3. It should show up in your home screen, click to run it.
4. Check the output. Note that the comment about Airplane Mode means that you should turn on Airplane Mode to enable OTA's, enabling Airplane Mode on its own will **not** reenable OTA's.

## If you used Julia's BinaryRenamer Script
1. Open KUAL
2. Open the BinaryRenamer menu.
3. If the OTA button says "Restore OTA Updates" then OTA's are blocked.

###### P.S. If somebody wanted to make a scriptlet that manages both of these, *I'm not going to stop you* 😂 (obviously you'll get credit lol)
