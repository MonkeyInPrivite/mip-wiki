OTA Blocking is one of the most important steps when it comes to jailbreaking, and if you're like me you want to make sure that you did it right. 

## Traditional Method
1. Download the [Check OTA Status Script](https://github.com/neura-neura/Check-OTA-status/releases/latest/download/Check.OTA.status_current.sh) by neura
2. Place the file in your documents folder
3. It should show up in your home screen, click to run it.
4. Check the output. Note that the comment about Airplane Mode means that you should turn on Airplane Mode to enable OTA's, enabling Airplane Mode on its own will **not** reenable OTA's.

## If you used Julia's [BinaryRenamer](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=4380046) Script
1. Open KUAL
2. Open the BinaryRenamer menu.
3. If the OTA button says "Restore OTA Updates" then OTA's are blocked.
