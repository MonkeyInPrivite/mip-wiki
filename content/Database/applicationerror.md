A scary error with a less scary meaning. 

## Should I be worried 
This error is a dialogue box that can pop up at seemingly random times and can be quite worrying. It happens when an application encounters a well - error. But rest assured, it is usually harmless and you can just close it.

## What is this?
In an older version of this page I attempted to explain this error, but Penguins (absolute legend btw) pointed out to me that my explanation was completely wrong, so I'll just put his explanation here 😅

The error will only be visible on application launch, e.g. an invalid appreg entry, which could occur for example in an illusion app if you don't copy the folder and only the .sh (or if the app has no config XML)

If the app itself has an error it'll just like tweak out. Look wrong cuz there's a bug or crash

App error happens when you like launch something with lipc with appmgrd and the app doesn't exist, is misconfugured, etc..  
Btw you see this most often in illusion apps due to user error (not copying correctly) or because of elder firmwares which make the scriptlet be a bit funky

Also this shouldn't appear in AdBreak iirc but you should document collecting debug info which is the popup that occurs when a process (mesquite) crashes (the exploit in AdBreak does that). Maybe in the same article
